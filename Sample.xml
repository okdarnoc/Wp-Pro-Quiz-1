<Instruction>The definition of asset management is to manage securities and futures portfolio or real estate investment trust for others. Auditors do not manage asset; they merely audit as their primary business. Fund managers manage Collective Investment Schemes; that is managing portfolios of securities and futures or real estate trust for a group of people. Therefore they are service providers in the asset management industry. Stockbrokers buy and sell Collective Investments Schemes on behalf of clients and may also manage securities portfolio for clients. Therefore they are service providers in the asset management industry. Independent Financial Advisers (IFA) provides advice on buying and selling Collective Investment Schemes. Therefore they are service providers of the asset management industry.</Instruction>

<Instruction>Under the SFO and the Banking Ordinance, authorised financial institutions (“AFIs”), which are regulated by the HKMA and include banks, have to be registered with the SFC as registered institutions if they wish to carry out an SFC-regulated activity. Clearly, the HKMA and the SFC must work closely together in relation to any SFC-regulated activities that are carried out by registered institutions. To this end, a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) has been signed between the two regulators, setting out their roles and responsibilities so as to minimise overlaps under the regulatory regime. The Insurance Authority is the major regulator of the insurance industry in Hong Kong.</Instruction>

<Instruction>The SFC seeks to work in partnership with the industry it regulates, encouraging a two-way dialogue that fosters a forum for an exchange of views and that encourages a strong regulator/regulate relationship.
In seeking the right balance, the SFC consults both industry practitioners and the public on proposed regulatory developments.
Rather than implement detailed standards, the SFC focuses on a higher-level articulation of what the SFC expects registered and licensed persons to do. This allows standards to be maintained for a variety of scenarios in a fast-changing marketplace, and enables businesses to decide how best to secure compliance with regulations having regard to their particular business context.</Instruction>
